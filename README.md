### New Features
Here's a series of pictures to demonstrate the features we've added:
#### 1. URL Processing with GPT-4 Integration

Our latest update introduces a revolutionary URL processing feature. Now, users can create flashcards directly from any website. This enhancement is powered by the integration of GPT-4, ensuring highly accurate and relevant content extraction. This is a significant leap from the previous version, which was limited to generating flashcards only from PDF or DOCX files.

#### 2. Customizable Flashcard Quantity

Flexibility is key in our new update. Users now have the option to specify the number of flashcards they wish to generate. This new feature contrasts with the earlier version's fixed flashcard output, offering a more tailored learning experience.

![image](https://github.com/varundeepakgudhe/auto_anki/assets/112991463/33137a6e-d613-4d8a-9407-5a961f612b98)


#### 3. Responsive GUI Design

We've overhauled the user interface, transitioning from a non-responsive tkinter-based GUI to a fully responsive design. This update enhances user interaction, making the application more adaptable to various screen sizes and user needs.

#### 4. Integrated Status Bar

Our new status bar provides real-time updates on the application's state. It indicates when the GUI is ready, when files are being processed, and when the processing is complete. This feature eliminates the need to manually check for file generation, streamlining the user experience.

In the screenshots, we can see the status bar shows the status of the application after the file is uploaded 
- 1) Processing file...  
- 2) File processed successfully.

</p>


#### 5. Improved Error Handling and Messaging

To further aid user understanding, we've implemented a message box that displays errors or confirms successful file generation. This feature provides clear, immediate feedback about the application's status and any issues encountered during file processing, a significant improvement over the previous version's lack of in-app updates.

In the below example, we removed the API KEY and tried to run the url processing:

#### 6. Rewritten GPT Integration for Enhanced Accuracy

In response to the latest changes in OpenAI's API, we've completely rewritten our GPT integration, upgrading to the cutting-edge GPT-4 model. This overhaul was crucial not only for adhering to new API standards but also for significantly boosting the precision of flashcard generation. Our team re-engineered this aspect from the ground up, ensuring smooth and efficient conversion, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of our learning tool.

#### 7. Introducing Our Ace Card: A Dynamic Web Interface ✨

Elevating our toolkit to new heights, we proudly introduce the seventh major update — a shift to a dynamic web application, enhancing user engagement far beyond what the previous tkinter GUI could offer. This new web interface boasts a dynamic background, a toggle button for effortless switching between file and URL processing, and a direct download option for the generated APKG files post-processing. It's a comprehensive upgrade that not only makes the application more visually appealing and interactive but also significantly enriches the user's experience with its streamlined and intuitive functionality.
